# Strategy
- Create components in /components
- Create primitives in /components/primitives. Build primitives with Radix Primitives where able.
- Use primitives to build the components. Use components to build the screens/pages in /pages
- Avoid global styles, just make global components that are used throughout the app.

# Styling Any Element
- Always use inline style props e.g. style={{...}} for styling. 
-- No styles via other JS props
-- No JS objects for CSS
-- No external CSS files except for universal, e.g. baseline resets, font families, brand accent color.
--- Browser resets ~ margins, padding, box-sizing.
--- Kep all global styles in globals.css which is inserted into app.js
- Control spacing between elements using padding not margin or otherwise.
- All spacing should be in 8px increments, or 4px only in small, compact areas.

#Element Positioning
Utopia IDE Compatibility
- Never use position: fixed for whole screen areas like modals etc., instead, use position: absolute within a position: relative parent container. Keep UI elements within their component's DOM hierarchy rather than trying to position them relative to the viewport because Utopia has it's own viewport system.
